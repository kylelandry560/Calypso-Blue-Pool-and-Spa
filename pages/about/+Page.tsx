                Education is our mission:
                {<br />}

                Free on site computerized <strong>water testing</strong> allows us the ability to create the exact “prescription” of chemicals for your pool water to stay crystal clear and healthy for the people that swim in that water.  We can help educate you how to use those chemicals to keep the water in balance so that you constantly maintain that  healthy environment.  We can also help you keep your pool “green” as there are a variety of filter, chemical and water heating options that can save you money on energy costs.
