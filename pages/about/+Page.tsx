                Many of our products are made in the USA because we believe in supporting this country and its people.  Many of our chemicals are supplied by Connecticut companies because we believe in supporting our community as well.

                Free on site computerized water testing allows us the ability to create the exact “prescription” of chemicals for your pool water to stay crystal clear and healthy for the people that swim in that water.  We can help educate you how to use those chemicals to keep the water in balance so that you constantly maintain that  healthy environment.  We can also help you keep your pool “green” as there are a variety of filter, chemical and water heating options that can save you money on energy costs.

                We carry a complete line of parts and can offer knowledgeable guidance on how to replace those parts yourself or have one of our experienced technicians do that work for you at your site.
